            <h1>WELCOME TO MY SCRIPTING LANGUAGES LECTURE FULL STACK + MICROSERVICES PROJECT</h1>
            <p>My project is an online store built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It utilizes Spring, a Java-based framework, for its backend services, which are designed using microservices architecture and managed with Eureka, a service registry. The frontend of the store is styled with Semantic UI, a modern CSS framework that provides a clean and intuitive design. With these powerful technologies, your e-commerce platform is able to handle a large volume of traffic and offer a seamless shopping experience to customers.</p>
